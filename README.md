# SimpleMIGRADvsBS
 A simple example of MIGRAD vs. Bootstrap

This Python code provides the example presented in Section 2.2.2 Uncertainties estimation with bootstrap, arxiv:2112.13436 [hep-ph]. 

It is a simple example that generates pseudodata according following a linear model and then compares the error estimation using a Hessian (MIGRAD library from MINUIT) and a standard bootstrap method.

This version also includes a Jupyter notebook with a more realistic example, fitting the LHCb data for the Pc(4312) signal.
